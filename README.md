 # ðŸ”µLÃ³gica de ProgramaciÃ³n - Encriptador de texto
This is a solution to the Encrypted Message Challenge. In this challenge, I aim to showcase the skills acquired through the Oracle | ONE program provided by ALURA LATAM.
<br><br>
**Part I**: HTML and CSS 
<br>
**Part II**: Javascript 
<br>
<br>
During the execution of this code, several JavaScript methods were used. Here are some of them to facilitate your search in the study process:
  [getElementById()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) |
  [toLowerCase()](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) |
  [navigator.clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard) 
 
   ## ðŸ”¹Main Page Elements

- Website title
- Text field for encryption/decryption
- Encrypt button
- Decrypt button
- Area to display encrypted/decrypted text
- Copy button

 ## ðŸ”¹Requirements

The encryption "keys" we will use are as follows:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter" <br>
The letter "i" is converted to "imes" <br>
The letter "a" is converted to "ai" <br>
The letter "o" is converted to "ober" <br>
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat" <br>

It should only work with lowercase letters.
Letters with accents or special characters should not be used.
It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to its original version.
